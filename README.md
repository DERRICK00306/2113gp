#### Description:

This is an investment simulation game in which the player invests in the financial market and aims to generate the highest earnings. 
World events and news will occur and result in unpredicted effects on asset prices. Insightful investors shall take quick actions to
change their market positions given a limited time to play. Alternatively, you may consider consulting with Sir Derrick, an affluent,
witted broker who is always willing to offer you some nice deals. Additionally, you may borrow from your mom to achieve your dream of
being a tycoon! However, everything comes with a cost… 

#### Rules:
This is a turn-based game with a limited total playing time (e.g., 3 mins). The player has an initial capital for investment. 

Every turn:  
1. Updated asset prices will be displayed and breaking news might occur. 
2. The player may purchase assets in the market directly, make a deal with a third party, and borrow money from mom. The player
can take up to two actions in total in each turn. 
3. The player may check their current holdings, gains, or losses anytime. 
4. The player may finish this turn anytime. 
5. Mom will relentlessly ask you for some favors if she has lent you some money (consider that as an interest).  

Notes: 

1. The news may reflect the future market trend to a certain extent; the player is expected to analyze its impact and 
make transactions accordingly. 
2. The third-party provides bulk purchase opportunities. The deals come with discounted prices but high quantities – 
the player may have to commit a significant amount of money to enjoy a discount.  
3. Borrowing is limited to a specific proportion of your total asset value (The proportion is to be confirmed).  Loans
 will be deducted from your total earnings and you may not repay them in advance. 
4. The turn will end automatically if the player completes two actions and their current holdings and liabilities 
(i.e. borrowings from your mom) will be printed.  
5. A list of transactions, the final holding asset and return will be printed at the end of the game (or when the player goes bankrupt).
