Description: 
This is an investment simulation game in which the player invests in the financial market and aims to generate the
highest earnings. World events and news will occur while insightful investors shall take quick actions to change their
market positions given a limited number of rounds to play. Alternatively, you may consider consulting with Sir
Derrick, an affluent, witted broker who is always willing to offer you deals with discount. Additionally, you may borrow
from your mom to achieve your dream of being a tycoon! However, you have to pay for some family events with the
payment proportional to your borrowing amount. Try to earn as much money as possible in ten rounds !

Rules:
The game has ten rounds in total. The player has an initial capital of $1,000,000 for investment.
Every round:
A board of command list will be displayed to show the available actions in each turn:
1. Updated asset prices will be displayed and breaking news might occur.
2. You may purchase assets in the market directly, make a deal with a third party, or borrow money from mom.
3. The player may check their current holdings, gains, or losses anytime.
4. The player may finish this turn anytime.
5. There's no interests for your borrowing, since you borrowed from your mom. Nonetheless, Mom will relentlessly
   ask you for some favors if she has lent you some money, which entails payment proportional to your borrowing
   amount.
6. You may end the round when you finish all actions you deem necessary and proceed to the next round.
7. Never have your cash down to zero. You will automatically become bankrupt and the game will end immediately.
8. The game will end automatically after ten rounds and your net investment return will be displayed.

Notes: 
1. The third-party provides bulk purchase opportunities. The deals come with discounted prices but always high
   quantities â€“ the player may have to commit a significant amount of money to enjoy a discount.
2. The total amount of borrowing may not exceed $1,000,000. Loans will be deducted from your total earnings at
   the end of the game and you can not repay them in advance.
3. You may choose to end the game in advance by typing in '-1' in the command panel.
4. A list of transactions, the final holding asset and return will be printed at the end of the game (or when the player
   goes bankrupt).

Let's start to play the game! Try to generate as more value as possible while not to be bankrupt.
